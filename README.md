# Installation
Ther should be no issues when running th code with python3, the libraries used are:
    1. pandas==1.2.4
    2. scikit-learn==0.22.2
    3. seaborn==0.10.1
    4. shap==0.34.0

# Project Motivation
This is a project towards achieving the Udacity data science nanodegree.
For this project, I use data from an unspecified Bank's to try and understand:

1. Can we identify which features explain churn?
2. Can we build a prediction that has cost optimization for misclassifications


# File Descriptions
There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. 
The notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
There is a data file; Churn_Modelling.csv

# Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here.
